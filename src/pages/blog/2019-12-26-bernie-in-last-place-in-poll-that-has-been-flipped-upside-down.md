A key weakness for the Bernie campaign has always been horrific polling when flipping polling charts upside down. Flipping the RealClearPolitics polling average chart upside down has Bernie Sanders on a downward trend slipping to last place. 

Bernie must either drop out or poll in first place in both the upside down and upright polls!
