If Bernie does indeed secure the nomination next spring, there is only one thing left to do before it becomes official.  

The DNC has released a statement confirming Bernie must indeed defeat John Delaney in an arm wrestling competition to receive the Democratic nomination.  

It is very possible Delaney defeats Bernie and receives the nomination at the next convention.
