Amy Klobuchar has taken a very strong position on good things and bad things. She is fully committed to fighting against bad things and fighting for good things! She has made it clear that she believes bad things are bad, and good things are good.

This extremely courageous and bold stance on this issue is what the country desperately need at the moment and can certainly hand her the nomination, and likely the presidency.
