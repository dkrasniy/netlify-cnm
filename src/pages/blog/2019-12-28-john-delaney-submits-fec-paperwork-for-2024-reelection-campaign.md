BREAKING: CNM has learned that John Delaney has filed the required paperwork with the Federal Election Commission for his 2024 reelection campaign. Given his strong polling, we believe it will be a landslide victory in 2020, and an even greater one in 2024. 



Those of us who were with John since the beginning know he was the first to announce his 2020 presidential bid back in 2017.
