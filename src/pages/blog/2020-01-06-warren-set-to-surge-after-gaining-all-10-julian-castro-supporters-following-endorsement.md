The race is practically over now that we know Castro has picked his candidate. Julian Castro has officially endorsed Elizabeth Warren after dropping out of the race a few days prior. If even half of Castro supporters (all 5 of them) flee to Warren, we can expect a 50%+ jump in the polls for Warren.  This endorsement is huge news, leaving AOC's Bernie endorsement in the dust.
